# Strom Project

## Overview
Strom is a free, open-source script that brings smart heating to your home. It uses weather forecasts and electricity price data to fine-tune energy use, finding a cost-effective heating schedule through convex optimization. With a smart plug, Strom quietly takes care of the details, automatically adjusting your heating to save energy. Itâ€™s a simple, clever way to make your home more efficient and eco-friendly.

## Usage

[Technical documentation](https://janbalanya.com/strom-docs/)

To run the main script manually:
```sh
python main.py  # python3 main.py for Mac users
```

Alternatively create [a cron job](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cron-jobs-in-linux/) or similar, that activates the main script hourly.


## Future Considerations
- Cron job installer
- Standalone executable
